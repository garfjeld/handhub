CTS happens when the median nerve is pressed at the wrist, in an area called the carpal tunnel.  This is on the bottom side of your hand, next to your wrist joint.  Pressure on this nerve can cause you to feel pain or other ‘funny feelings’ in the skin of your hand, or make your hand weaker. This pressure can happen for different reasons including diseases of the joint like arthritis, wrist damage, being overweight, being pregnant and too much water in your body (water retention).

The carpal tunnel is on the palmar side of your hand, and formed by the carpals (small bones) of your hand and a ligament called the flexor retinaculum.  The median nerve and a number of tendons for hand movements run through this tunnel.  

The median nerve has a number of functions, including some of the movements of your thumb, as well as sensation to your thumb, index, middle and half the ring finger. This means that when it is compressed the symptoms you get relate to this — predominantly pain in the area supplied by the median nerve.  Compression can also lead to weakness of the small muscles that move your thumb, and they may become atrophied (reduce in size).
