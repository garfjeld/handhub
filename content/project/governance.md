Our service strives for constant patient-led service improvement, which requires open and honest assessment of our performance. Six-weekly governance meetings are held and the minutes and outcomes are publicly available. We will also always provide information about our interactions with the National Health Service, specialist and learned societies, patient interest groups and industry so we can be held to account as we strive for patient-led service improvement.
